# Tesla Clone

This project is a React-based web application that aims to clone the landing page of the official Tesla website. It showcases various Tesla products including vehicle models, solar solutions, and accessories.

## Features

*   Display of Tesla vehicle models: Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y.
*   Sections for "Lowest Cost Solar Panels in America" and "Solar for New Roofs".
*   An "Accessories" section.
*   Responsive header with navigation links.
*   Call-to-action buttons like "Custom Order", "Existing Inventory", "Order Now", "Shop Now" (note: these are for visual demonstration and are likely non-functional in this clone).

## Technologies Used

*   React
*   Redux (with Redux Toolkit)
*   Material UI (for icons)
*   Styled Components
*   React Reveal (for animations)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tesla-clone.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tesla-clone
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server and view the application in your browser:

```bash
npm start
```
This will typically open the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the main directories:

*   `public/`: Contains the `index.html` file, manifest, and other static assets.
*   `src/`: Contains all the React application source code.
    *   `App.js`: The main application component that orchestrates the pages.
    *   `index.js`: The entry point of the React application.
    *   `components/`: Contains reusable UI components like `Header.js`, `Home.js`, `Section.js`.
    *   `features/`: Intended for Redux state management slices (e.g., `counter/` is an example).
    *   `images/`: Stores images and logos used in the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

*   `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
*   `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
*   `npm run eject`: Removes the single dependency (react-scripts) and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project. **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
